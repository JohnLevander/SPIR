# SPIR (Susceptible-Prophylactic-Infected-Recovered) Agent-Based Simulation Model

## Software Pre-requisites
* Python 2.7+
* Python Libraries: matplotlib

## Download Project from GitHub
* Open a terminal
* Navigate to the directory where you want to download the SPIR code
* Type: git clone https://github.com/bertybaums/SPIR.git

## Configure
You can configure the simulation for running by changing the values of the parameters in the _config.txt_ file.

## Execute
To execute the simulation,
* Open a terminal
* Navigate to the SPIR root directory
* Type: python SPIR/Main.py config.txt

You should see as a result a graphic with the dynamic over time of agents in the Susceptible, Prophylactic, Infectious, Recovered state.
